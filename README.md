## The Golden Rule:

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1. **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
in notebook
1. **Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
page1
*header
*2 forms (done)
page2 (bottom) 
*ul list of times append a li to it
*checkbox (clickable toggle)(supabase call)
*delete all button(clickable)(supabase call)
page2 (top)
*form 
*submit that creats new items on list
1. **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?**
page1
*header displays info
*2 forms for sign in and up
page2 (bottom)
*ul holds list
*checkbox displays purchassed or not
*delete clea
*form with inputs for infomation needed
*submit adds item to the list
1. **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"**
1. **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?**
1. **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done**
1. **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:

-   Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
-   Consider your data model.
    -   What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need?
    -   What are the key/value pairs?
    -   What arrays might you need?
    -   What needs to live in a persistence layer?
-   Is there some state we need to initialize?
-   Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)
